<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an incoming Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), under the supervision of Professor [Andrew W. Lo](https://alo.mit.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics from [Peking University School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) in January 2024, advised by Professor [Lan Wu](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/peoplefaculty/14.html). I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Peking University in 2019.  

My research interests include investments and actuarial sciences. My research has been recognized by the [S&P Global Academic ESG Research Award (2022)](https://www.pm-research.com/SPGlobal-ESGAward) and the [Best Paper Prize for Young Scholars in the Annual Conference of the Operations Research Society of China (Financial Engineering and Risk Management Branch, 2023)](https://www.stat-center.pku.edu.cn/en/Events/news_en/1365174.htm). 

My key research topics are:
- **Investments**
  + Factor investing
  + High-frequency investing/trading
  + Sustainable investing
- **Actuarial Sciences**

Here is my latest [CV](./CV/CYZhao_CV.pdf).
